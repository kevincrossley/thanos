# thanos
This script was made in response to fivethirtyeight's weekly riddler:


> Thanos, the all-powerful supervillain, can snap his fingers and destroy half of all the beings in the universe.
>
> But what if there were 63 Thanoses, each snapping his fingers one after the other? Out of 7.5 billion people on Earth, how many can we expect would survive?
>
> If there were N Thanoses, what would the survival fraction be?

My script assumes that for each snap, Thanos will keep killing until at least 50% of the population is gone. Then if there is only 1 person left, each snap will have a 50% chance of killing that final person
